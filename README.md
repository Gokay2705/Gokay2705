### Hi there 👋

I'm a student of IT boot-camp and after I completed my education, I want to be a cloud engineer and AWS Solution Architect. I have an experience with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Jenkins and Amazon Web Services. I like to follow and get connect with people to learn something interesting that helps to develop my career. You can see my work at my repo.
